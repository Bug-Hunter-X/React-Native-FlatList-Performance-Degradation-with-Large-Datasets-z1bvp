This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with extensive datasets.  The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problem with slow scrolling and potential crashes. The solution, presented in `FlatListSolution.js`, involves implementing key optimization, using `ItemSeparatorComponent`, and potentially employing `React.memo` or `useMemo` for performance enhancements.  This example highlights the importance of efficient rendering and key management in optimizing FlatList performance for better user experience.
